            <h3>Color Sensor</h3>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This module is the core color sensor of the TCS34725FN color light digitizer of AMS AG. The sensor
provides digital output of red, green, blue (RGB) and clear light sensing values. The integrated infrared
blocking filter can minimize the infrared spectral components of the incident light, and can accurately
perform color measurement. It has high sensitivity, wide dynamic range and infrared blocking filter.
Minimize the effects of IR and UV spectral components to produce accurate color measurements. And
with ambient light intensity detection and shieldable interrupt. Communication via I2C interface.
